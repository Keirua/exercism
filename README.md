My personnal solutions to some of the Rust exercises on exercism.io

There's really no reason to cheat on such a website where the purpose is to learn, so use these solutions only to compare them with what you found.

It's not worth much algorithmically-wise but it's a good way for me to explore new ideas and ways to do things in Rust.
